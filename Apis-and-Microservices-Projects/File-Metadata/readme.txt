API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp

User stories:

I can submit a form that includes a file upload.

The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.

When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

Usage :

Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

Hint:

To handle the file uploading you should use the multer npm package.
